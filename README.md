Personal Portfolio Project (The Odin Project, JavaScript Path, Advanced HTML and CSS Course, Responsive Design)

This is a fully responsive portfolio website displaying some of my projects. Each project card contains a screenshot and a short description of the project, a link to the github page with the source code and a live preview link. Responsive design is achieved with the help of flexbox, grid, <picture> element and media queries.
